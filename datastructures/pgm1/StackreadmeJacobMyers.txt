Stack implementation readme

this serves as a supplement to my stack program.

compile: 
javac Stack.java

run:
java Stack

will ask immediately for input file, i included a text file called teststack.txt containing input string:
"10 1.push 2.push 5.push pop 2.push 6.push 7.push 11.push 12.push pop 18.push pop 12.push pop 20.push 21.push"

feel free to try it with any other input file of similar format.
